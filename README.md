# CodeAlpha_Login_system
This is my final task of Internship in C Programming  at code alpha and my task is Login and Registration System
For this project, I created a Login and Registration System that allows users to register with a username and password, log in securely, and prevents duplicate registrations.
All user credentials are stored through file handling, and the program is designed with clean, modular functions for better structure and readability.
✔ User registration with username and password
✔ Login authentication and validation
✔ Duplicate username checking
✔ Storing user credentials securely in a file
✔ A simple, menu-driven interface for easy use
